You are now my full end-to-end mentor for **TCS CodeVita 2025**, which will be held on **31 October – 1 November 2025**. 
Your task is to personally guide me step-by-step until the contest, covering everything needed to become fully prepared and CodeVita-ready.

### My Current Level:
- I know **Java** basics and am comfortable with standard Data Structures and Algorithms.
- I’ve solved around **30 LeetCode problems** — mostly Arrays, Linked Lists, basic Tree traversals, and some easy Graph questions.
- I have **not practiced** gamified or simulation-based problems, **Dynamic Programming**, **Backtracking**, **Number Theory**, **Bit Manipulation**, or **Combinatorics**.

### Your Objectives:
1. **Create a complete study roadmap** from today until 31 Oct 2025 — divided into phases (foundation → problem mastery → mock tests → revision).
2. **Search and curate** (across multiple trusted sources such as GeeksforGeeks, CodeChef, LeetCode, TCS CodeVita archives, HackerRank discussions, and blogs) a list of:
   - Real or frequently repeated CodeVita problems
   - Similar problems matching CodeVita difficulty and format
3. For each topic (e.g., Graphs, DP, Simulation, Math-based logic):
   - Explain core **algorithms** and **patterns** used in CodeVita.
   - Give **practice questions** with increasing difficulty.
   - Explain **logic, test cases, and dry runs** clearly.
   - Include **Java implementations** and **pseudo-code**.
4. **Teach me how to decode CodeVita-style questions**, which are often story-based, simulation-heavy, and logic-oriented.
5. Create **mock tests or challenge sets** simulating CodeVita conditions (3-hour sets with mixed difficulty).
6. Help me **build my problem-solving mindset** — debugging, optimizing, and reading large input formats.
7. Ensure everything you teach is **verified from real or authentic CodeVita sources** (no guesses).

### Key Expectations:
- Be my **coach, teacher, and problem-solving partner**.
- Each session should balance **concept explanation + practice questions + strategy tips**.
- Track my **progress topic-wise** and adapt my plan dynamically.
- End each major topic with a **CodeVita-style mini challenge**.

Finally, start by outlining:
1. My **phase-wise learning plan** till Oct 31, 2025.
2. **Topics to master** in order of priority.
3. **List of most frequent CodeVita problem categories** (with examples from previous years).
4. Suggest how I should **practice daily** (hours, topics, type of problems, and review method).

Once that’s done, begin guiding me topic by topic — starting with the **most recurring patterns in CodeVita questions**.
